# Machine Learning and Cluster Algebras
Here we are experimenting with machine learning techniques for classification problems in cluster algebras

The file "Auxillary_code_for_generating_cluster_algebra_data.ipynb" is used to generate the cluster algebra data we wish to study. It uses the Sage kernel and the cluster algebra package here: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/cluster_algebra.html
